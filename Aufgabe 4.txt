a) cursor stability (is default)

b) create table without primary key:

   CREATE TABLE OPK
   (
       ID int,
       NAME varchar(1000)
   )

   Sampledata:

   INSERT INTO "VSISP16"."OPK" (ID,NAME) VALUES (0,'Max')
   INSERT INTO "VSISP16"."OPK" (ID,NAME) VALUES (1,'Patrick')
   INSERT INTO "VSISP16"."OPK" (ID,NAME) VALUES (2,'Simon')

c) SELECT * FROM OPK FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY
   SELECT * FROM SYSIBMADM.LOCKS_HELD; (SELECT * FROM SYSIBMADM.LOCKS_HELD WHERE AGENT_ID = '64088‘)

   Locks:
   INTERNALV_LOCK (SHARE) 
   INTERNALV_LOCK (SHARE)
   INTERNALP_LOCK (SHARE)
   TABLE_LOCK (auf SYSIBM, INTENT SHARE)

d) set current ISOLATION RS;
    INTERNALV_LOCK (SHARE)
    ROW_LOCK (auf OPK, NEXT KEY SHARE)
    INTERNALV_LOCK (SHARE)
    INTERNALP_LOCK (SHARE)
    TABLE_LOCK (auf OPK, INTENT SHARE)
    TABLE_LOCK (auf SYSIBM, INTENT SHARE)

4.2
a)  first connection: select * from VSISP16.OPK where id > 2;
    second connection: insert into VSISP16.OPK VALUES (4,'hello’);
    Added line was visible after another select statement

b)  second connection gets blocked and has to wait for the first connect before it can insert/update
    first connection gets blocked a aswell when you try another query
    TABLE_LOCK auf OPK (SHARE)
    second connection data gets committed  after first connection commits

c)  first connection: select * from VSISP16.OPK where id = 2;
    second connection: UPDATE VSISP16.OPK SET NAME = 'ups' where id = 1
    both connections won’t answer, no further commit possible
    the whole table gets locked, therefore the update of the first connection won’t work.

d)  CREATE TABLE MPK
    (
        ID int PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
        NAME varchar(1000)
    )
    same as with c, both connection won’t answer and both won’t do anything on the table without an commit

4.3
a)  Connection 1 can change the row that is selected by connection 2, but connection 2 has to wait until connection 1 is committed. Connection 1 has a ROW_LOCK (X = eXclusive) onto its row, connection 2    doesn’t lock the row, therefore connection 1 can still update it.
b)  RR locks the whole table, therefore other agents can’t do anything furthermore to the table
